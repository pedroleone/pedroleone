<h2>February 12, 2017 <small>Day 6</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Javascript Calculator Refactor</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: After a lot of bugs I decided to recode from scratch the JS Calculator. </p>



<h2>February 11, 2017 <small>Day 5</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Week 5 of MongoDB for Developers</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: Still sick, but at least I finished all the homework for this week's course.</p>

<h2>February 10, 2017 <small>Sick day</small></h2>

<h2>February 9, 2017 <small>Day 4</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Worked on styling the JS Calculator</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: Man, CSS layout is really hard.</p>


<h2>February 8, 2017 <small>Day 3</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Worked on the Javascript Calculator front-end project.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: It was really fun! I got the first and second user story fully working, the thrid one will be very simple. I think the hard part will be styling the calculator.</p>
<p>Onward to the fouth day!</p>

<h2>February 7, 2017 <small>Day 2</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Started on the "No repeats please" advanced algorithm on FCC</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: For the first time I was completely lost. It turns out that string permutation is an advanced algorithm using dynamic programming and recursion. So there's that. It's going to be a long road...</p>

<h2>February 6, 2017 <small>Day 1</small></h2>
<p><strong>Today's Progress</strong>: Finally finished the Exact Change algorithm, and also completed the next one, Inventory Update.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: Back to the 100 days of code challenge, after a lot of sick days and toothache. So much time lost, so I think it's best to go back to day one.</p>
<p>I feel kind of bad for letting the ball drop so quickly, only 11 days in. In my defense, I wasn't completely off - I still managed to go through the MongoDB for Developers, and it's going well. But I realize it's not nearly enough, so here I am back to the challenge. </p>
<p>But I guess I'm going to make a few changes to the rules I'm following. I have since abandoned my facebook account, and I don't feel like using twitter for the same reason. So this repo is the only place that I will post to.</p>

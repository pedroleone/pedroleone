    '<b>Desecration</b> – the villain seeks to desecrate a location, an item, or an event (desecration could be targeted on religion or against a tradition)',
    '<b>Destroy Community</b> – the villain is trying to kill, economically destroy, or otherwise irreparably damage a particular community (possibly a sub-community or organization). He could have various motives, ranging from annoyance to following the orders of a greater villain.',
    '<b>Destroy Good-Aligned Group</b> – the villain seeks to destroy a good-aligned group, either because their morals offend him, or as the first step in a larger plan ',

}

var table1_12b = {
    'title': 'Table 1-12: Villainous Concealment - How He’s Concealing It',
    'table': [
['<b>Assassination</b>. The Villain is targeting anyone who could identify him from a past identity he wants to keep secret, or is killing those who know about his plans. In other words, the villain might be trying to conceal himself or his activities; these aren’t always the same. A villain engaged in secret activities might be completely certain he can’t be identified, but still worried that his plot could be uncovered. Assassinations might be the last resort when a villainous plot is already starting to fall apart. The villain’s minions might be his targets, too, if things have gone badly and the villain is concealing his tracks.',
'<b>Eliminating Evidence (damage control)</b>. The villain is trying to eliminate evidence of a plan or crime that failed, and that he has written off. He might be taking several actions at once: killing his own minions that were involved, killing witnesses, stealing documents and other evidence, etc.',
'<b>Eliminating Evidence (mopping up)</b>. The villain is eliminating evidence of a plan or crime that has succeeded – covering his tracks, in other words. If he up a usurper on the throne (to choose one example), he might still need to kill the minion or dupe who poisoned the true king. Or, he might need to change some historical records that could reveal the usurper’s non-noble pedigree. Most crimes leave evidence behind.',
'<b>Frame-up</b>. The villain is framing another person (or monster) for a crime he committed himself. The target might be a minion, an innocent bystander the villain dislikes, or a monster such as a nearby dragon (dragons being excellent fall-guys for arsonists). Remember also: from the villain’s perspective, the enemy of his enemy is not his friend – he’s a potential fall guy.',
'<b>Lair-Building (rural)</b>. The villain is building a concealed lair to hide himself and his activities from the group indicated in column 1. This could be the activity of a mindless monster (in which case column 1 is irrelevant), or it might be part of the thought-out plan of a relatively intelligent mastermind.',
'<b>Lair-Building (urban or village)</b>. The villain is building a hidden lair within a civilized community. Again, this could be the instinctive action of an unintelligent beast (such as a giant spider nesting in an attic, or a ghoul making tunnels under a cemetery) or might be the first step in a mastermind’s plan (e.g., an evil priest digging a secret basement-complex).',
'<b>Organization (façade)</b>. The villain is creating an organization of innocent-looking minions in plain sight, but with a secret agenda for the group. The organization might be a cover story for existing minions (yes, we are all circus performers!) or it might be a way of recruiting unsuspecting locals to join. In this sort of operation, the villain is primarily trying to conceal the organization’s secret operations rather than to conceal himself; he might even be a prominent ci tizen of the town or village where the organization is being created. His plan might include recruiting people away from the local community to a rural “temple” or “lodge,” or the organization’s base might be located right in the middle of the community (for example, an innocent-looking store that actually fences stolen goods brought in by caravan from the nearby city). To determine the organization’s secret agenda, you might want to roll again on the Master Table. Note that this sort of plan is almost certainly the agenda of an intelligent villain, even if the operation is run by a minion with lower intelligence. ',
'<b>Organization (secret)</b>. The villain is creating a secret organization of minions, meeting in secret with no cover story for their activities. This could be a secret cult, a plan to overthrow the government, or the unification of wererat tribes in the sewer tunnels of a large city. Secret societies can take many forms if you’re creative.',
'<b>Secret identity (establishing)</b>. The villain is disguised within the human population, and is building up a new identity for himself. He might have forged documents, or an altered body form. In this case, the villain has created a new identity – if he has taken someone’s place, see below for comments.',
'<b>Secret Identity (learning)</b>. The villain has replaced a human in the community, and is learning the details of his new identity. This is not a strategy limited to shape-changing villains; anyone can pretend to be someone from far away. The villain might be making some blunders as he impersonates the dead or absent target – he might not know, for example, that the king was a vegetarian, or where the merchant hid the key to his treasure room.']]

var table1_13 = {
    'title': 'Table 1-13: Conversion',
    'table': [
'<b>Addiction</b>. The villain uses peoples’ addictions to get them to take evil actions',
'<b>Bad Advice</b>. The villain advises people to engage in evil actions, working from some position of authority he has already obtained (e.g., a good priest, a military leader, a city alderman, a prosecutor, etc). The villain might be giving insidious advice to the population at large (by preaching war, for example), or he might be in the position of an adviser to a noble, a guildmaster, or some other powerful person. The “evil vizier” of Arabian folklore is a prime example of this sort of villain.',
'<b>Blackmail</b>. The villain is blackmailing people into committing evil actions. These actions might or might not actually change their alignments, depending in how you use alignment in your game.',
'<b>Debts</b>. The villain is a moneylender or has control of money (a local exchequer or military quartermaster, perhaps) and is using peoples’ debts to force them into undertaking evil actions.',
'<b>Demonic Gifts</b>. The villain gives “gifts” of a demon’s assistance. Eventually, the victim becomes reliant or even addicted to such help, and falls into the villain’s (or the demon’s) clutches as a helpless pawn.',
'<b>Enchantment</b>. The villain is magically charming people, then persuading or ordering them to commit evil actions.',
'<b>Hostages</b>. The villain takes hostages, compelling their kin or the hostages themselves to perform evil actions in exchange for freedom or good treatment.',
'<b>Magic</b>. The villain uses magical means (using an item, probably) to change the alignment of his victims. The effect might only work from long-term exposure to the item, or it might be instantaneous.',
'<b>Persuasion</b>. The silver-tongued devil is able to convert people to his cause by words alone. This might be through religious conversions, or by persuading people to take specifically evil actions. This is the “tempter” type of villain common in European morality tales (eve and the serpent, Marlowe and Goethe’s versions of the Doctor Faustus story, etc.)',
'<b>Money</b>. The villain simply pays people to take evil actions.',
'<b>Obligations of Honor</b>. The villain is using peoples’ open-ended promises and oaths as a means of getting evil actions done. The fictionalized mafia of the Godfather movies is an excellent example: by doing a favor in exchange for another, unspecified, favor in the future, the villain can force people to undertake tasks they wouldn’t have agreed to ahead of time if they had known what would be required of them.',
'<b>Minions Give Bad Advice</b>. The villain’s minions advise evil actions from positions of authority. The plan is basically the same as “Bad Advice” above, but performed by the villain’s minions instead of by the villain himself. The villain remains one step removed from the dirty work, possibly more anonymous than someone in a position to be giving advice.',
'<b>Minions Take Hostages</b>. The villain’s minions hold hostages to compel evil actions from the hostage’s friends or kin. This is like the “Hostages” entry above, but the minions are the ones on the front line. As always, the weakness in the plan is that if you want something done right, you need to do it yourself.',
'<b>Minions Use Addictions</b>. The villain’s minions use peoples’ addictions to get them to take evil actions. The minions might be supplying people with addictive substances, might be taking over the operations of existing suppliers by force or guile, or might be blackmailing people (assuming the drugs are illegal). Minions Use Blackmail. Similar to the “Blackmail” plot, but the villain’s minions are blackmailing people into performing evil actions rather than the villain himself.',
'<b>Minions Use Enchantment</b>. The villain’s minions are charming people to get them to perform evil actions. This might be the same as “Enchantment” above, but it might be that the villain himself doesn’t have the magical capability to enchant people. If the villain’s minion is able to use such magic, and the villain isn’t, keep in mind that the minion might have his own secret agenda.',
'<b>Minions Use Magic</b>. The villain’s minions are directly changing peoples’ moral alignment with the use of magic – whether this is an inherent capability or by the use of a powerful magic item (or even an artifact). As with all minion-type plans, the minions might be slightly incompetent, or might be intelligent enough to have their own agenda.',
'<b>Minions Use Money</b>. The villain’s minions pay people to undertake evil actions. This is only different from subversion” in that the actions are presumably heinous enough to cause a possible change in alignment.',
'<b>Minions Use Obligations of Honor</b>. The villain has a minion who is a feudal lord, a crime boss, or who holds some other station in which people make open-ended promises to him. At the villain’s request or command, the minion is able to take advantage of these openended promises to extort actions people would never directly have agreed to.',
'<b>Minions Use Persuasion</b>. The villain’s minions persuade people into a religious or moral conversion to evil (or Chaos, depending upon the campaign). Most likely, the villain has the minion doing the job because the villain lacks the charisma (or the human appearance) to pull it off.',
